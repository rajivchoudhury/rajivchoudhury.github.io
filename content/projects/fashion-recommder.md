## Description

This application recommends nearest five fashion products based on the uploaded photo. The User Interface is implemented using streamlit library in Python. For recommendation, I have used a pre-trained model, namely, ResNet, which has been trained on over a million images and the dataset used for recommendation is available on kaggle. I have used K-nearest Neighbours algorithm from sci-kit learn library as a metric for finding out the five near similar image for recommendation. I have used Streamlit for front-end deployment.
