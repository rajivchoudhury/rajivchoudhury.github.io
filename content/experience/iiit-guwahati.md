### Description

- Developed a prototype application which helps person with Motor Neuron Disease (MND) to be able to communicate with the environment.
- Used EMOTIV Insight device for data collection, which is a 5 channel device.
- Made a real-time application from the trained model, where I predict data after collecting 1 sec of sample from the device and process it and give a classification of person thinking state (which is one of the three - idle, move cursor or select).

### Experience in the city of Guwahati

As our institute was located in the outskirts of Guwahati and very near to the beautiful Meghalaya, It had amazing views of mountains and most of the days there were clear skies as presented in the following clicks of mine.
